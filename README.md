# Camel Up Game

This Python-based simulation of the Camel Up board game recreates its core mechanics, dynamically visualizes board states, and provides probabilistic guidance for strategic decision-making, with the aim of modeling diverse betting strategies and running extensive simulations to assess whether outcomes mainly hinge on random factors or if skillful play can yield a discernible edge. Through data-driven methods and systematic experimentation, this project seeks to clarify the gameâ€™s balance between chance and strategy, highlighting any meaningful predictive elements.
